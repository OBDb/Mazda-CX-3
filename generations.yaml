    description: "The Mazda CX-3 is a subcompact crossover SUV based on the Mazda2 platform (model code DK), revealed on November 19, 2014, ahead of the 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show as a production vehicle for the 2016 model year. Built on a modified version of the Mazda2 platform, it featured Mazda's Kodo 'Soul of Motion' design language with sleek proportions, flowing lines, and a distinctive front fascia, offering a more premium appearance than competitors in the segment. The CX-3 was powered by multiple engine options globally: in North America, a 2.0L Skyactiv-G four-cylinder engine producing 146 horsepower was paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Global markets received additional powertrain options including 1.5L and 2.0L Skyactiv-G petrol engines and 1.5L and 1.8L Skyactiv-D diesel engines. The interior featured upscale design and materials unusual for the segment, with a driver-focused cockpit offering a standard 7-inch touchscreen with rotary controller, available head-up display, and premium materials on higher trims. Production began in Japan (Hiroshima and Hōfu plants) and Thailand (Rayong since 2015). The CX-3 established itself as one of the more engaging and premium options in the subcompact crossover segment, emphasizing style and driving dynamics."

    description: "The Mazda CX-3 received a minor facelift in 2018 including a new split horizontal chrome grille design, fog lamps, revised tail lamps, chassis tweaks, enhanced safety features with the i-Activesense suite, a centre console armrest, and replacement of the manual handbrake with an electronic parking brake. Starting from April 2020, Mazda added a 1.5-litre four-cylinder Skyactiv-G petrol engine option for select markets including Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, Singapore, and Malaysia. Apple CarPlay and Android Auto became standard equipment for the US market from 2020. Production shifted from Japan (Hiroshima and Hōfu plants through 2022) to Mexico (Salamanca since 2022) and Thailand (Rayong). Regional market availability varies: the CX-3 was discontinued in the United States after 2021 (replaced by CX-30), Europe sales ended December 2021, while continuing in Japan, Australia, Thailand, Mexico, and other markets through 2024 and beyond."

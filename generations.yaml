    description: "The Mazda CX-3 was introduced as Mazda's entry in the rapidly growing subcompact crossover segment, built on a modified version of the Mazda2 platform. Featuring Mazda's Kodo 'Soul of Motion' design language, it offered a more premium appearance than many competitors with its sleek proportions, flowing lines, and distinctive front fascia. In North America, it was powered exclusively by a 2.0L SkyActiv-G four-cylinder engine producing 146 horsepower, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and available with either front-wheel drive or i-Activ all-wheel drive. Global markets received additional powertrain options including smaller displacement gasoline engines and a 1.5L diesel. The interior showcased upscale design and materials unusual for the segment, with a driver-focused cockpit featuring a standard 7-inch touchscreen with rotary controller, available head-up display, and premium materials on higher trims including leather upholstery with suede inserts. Despite its small exterior footprint, clever packaging provided reasonable passenger space in the front seats, though rear seat and cargo space were limited compared to some competitors. Standard safety features expanded throughout its production run, eventually including automated emergency braking, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert, with higher trims adding adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, and automatic high beams. A series of minor updates throughout its lifecycle brought subtle styling refinements, interior improvements, and additional features, with a more substantial refresh in 2019 adding enhanced sound insulation, refined suspension tuning, and available full-leather seating. The CX-3 established itself as one of the more engaging and premium options in the subcompact crossover segment, emphasizing style and driving dynamics over maximum utility."

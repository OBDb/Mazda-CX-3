    description: "The Mazda CX-3 is a subcompact crossover SUV based on the Mazda2 platform (model code DK), revealed on November 19, 2014, ahead of the 2014 Los Angeles Auto Show as a production vehicle for the 2016 model year. Built on a modified version of the Mazda2 platform, it featured Mazda's Kodo 'Soul of Motion' design language with sleek proportions, flowing lines, and a distinctive front fascia, offering a more premium appearance than competitors in the segment. The CX-3 was powered by multiple engine options globally: in North America, a 2.0L Skyactiv-G four-cylinder engine producing 146 horsepower was paired with a six-speed automatic transmission and available with either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. Global markets received additional powertrain options including 1.5L and 2.0L Skyactiv-G petrol engines and 1.5L and 1.8L Skyactiv-D diesel engines. The interior featured upscale design and materials unusual for the segment, with a driver-focused cockpit offering a standard 7-inch touchscreen with rotary controller, available head-up display, and premium materials on higher trims. The CX-3 received a minor facelift in 2018 including a new split horizontal chrome grille design, fog lamps, revised tail lamps, chassis tweaks, enhanced safety features, a centre console armrest, and an electronic parking brake. Production began in Japan (Hiroshima and Hōfu plants through 2022), Thailand (Rayong since 2015), and Mexico (Salamanca since 2022). Regional market availability varies: the CX-3 was sold in the United States and Europe from 2016–2021, Canada from 2016–2022, while continuing production in Japan, Australia, Thailand, and Mexico through 2025 and beyond. The CX-3 established itself as one of the more engaging and premium options in the subcompact crossover segment, emphasizing style and driving dynamics."
